# ACZ_CE_freecam_script

Descrition:
-----------
A Cheat Engine table file containing scripts that allows the user to enable a very rudimentary freecam mode in when running Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War in the PCSX2 emulator. This table is made of multiple scripts that enable the freecam mode not only during flight, but also in the hangar during the aircraft/SpW selection screen. 

Besides the freecam scripts the table also comes with optional scripts that can modify some graphic parameters on the fly, locate entities and print their coordinates and even enable what seems to be a dummied out "free look" option.

The scripts themselves use a mix of assembly and LUA languages to perform the operations required to disable the game's camera code and give the user control to manipulate it. If you want to modify this table but want to get acquainted with the language or with Cheat Engine in general you can head over to their official [wiki](https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=Main_Page).
